        <p>
          Hi, I'm Ray Guo â€” a developer passionate about building user-centered
          software experiences. I enjoy solving real-world problems with clean
          code, thoughtful design, and modern web technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interests include front-end development, UI/UX, and learning new
          frameworks. When I'm not coding, I love piano, reading, and the gym!
        </p>
      </div>
